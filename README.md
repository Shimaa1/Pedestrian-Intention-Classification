# Pedestrian Intention Classification

Pedestrian intention classifier is a human pose based classifier which achieves 80+% accuracy on JAAD dataset. The purpose of this classifier is to explore the machine learning on pedestrian crossing road intention for autonomous vehicle.

80+% accuracy on JAAD dataset.

# False Positive
![Build Status](https://github.com/xiaofeng419/Pedestrian-Intention-Classification/blob/master/Image/non-cross.png)

Some false positive observed due to pose feature inherent lack of context infomation.
 

# Todos

 - Train image sequences (14 frames) as input instead of single image
 - Add context info as feature such as road segmentation and traffic light.
